In this project, we are utilizing the Django framework to build an application. This Django framework uses an MVT architecture to function. Python was used to build it. Django files are already built into this framework. Therefore, a developer may create a web application with ease. If we look at how certain language developers can only have a basic understanding of a code, we can see how it is slowly losing favor due to the PHP framework. It has better functionality and is generally more secure and cost-effective. 
 
This project aims to develop a login-based application that lets users access a list of students and, if necessary, amend or update their personal data. The students are involved in a range of activities for our project. 
• Module for users 
• students Module 
 
In this user module, the user can only access the dashboard, which includes the ability to view student profiles but not student reports. This program allows us to register two different categories of users. One type is a student who can check the student report using his login  information. Another type is a user who can simply check the students.
